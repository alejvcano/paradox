SLiM.zip contains the necessary files to perform evolutionary simulations using the underlying nominal distributions for Dengue and p53 using SLiM (evol_dengue.slim and evol_p53.slim, respectively).

The input folder contains the mutation spectra and DFEs for each model, as well as the initial genotype sequence in FASTA format.

Further information about SLiM usage and Eidos programming language can be found in http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf
