Nominal_dengue.txt contains the data to create the nominal distribution displayed in Figs. 2 and 3, from Dolan et al 2021. The file contains
information about each beneficial mutation, such as genomic position, mutation type, etc. To construct the nominal
distribution we use the selection coefficients given by the column "relativeFitness" and the mutation rates given 
by the column "muRate."

To simulate a fixed distribution of mutations, use the SLiM code provided in code/SLiM.
