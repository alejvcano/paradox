Nominal_dengue.txt contains the data to create the nominal distribution displayed in Figs. 2 and 3. The file contains
information about each beneficial mutation, such as genomic position, mutation type, etc. To construct the nominal
distribution we use the selection coefficients given by the column "relativeFitness" and the mutation rates given 
by the column "muRate."
