(unfinished) This combines the data on frequency from Table 1 with the data on mutation rates. The frequency covers the three different backgrounds.  To get this combined value, I had to infer the numerator and denominator, because the denominators are not the same in the 3 backgrounds.  The number of mutants observed is sometimes zero.
